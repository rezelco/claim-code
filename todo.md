- [x] Make card background semi-transparent with blur effect
- [x] Adjust card rounded corners to match screenshot

**5. Input Field Styling:** [COMPLETED ✅]

**7. Color Scheme Unification:** [COMPLETED ✅]

### 200% Darker Plan:
- [x] Push all opacity to 95-100% (maximum possible)
- [x] Use only purple-900 (darkest purple everywhere)
- [x] Add more dark purple elements for coverage
- [x] Get approval for extreme darkness
- [x] Implement maximum darkness changes

### Problem Analysis:
Current purple elements are too light:
- `purple-100` with 50% opacity = very faint
- `purple-300` with 40% opacity = still too subtle
- Need stronger purple colors or much higher opacity

### EXTREME 200% Darker Changes Made:
- Main gradient: `from-purple-800/80` → `from-purple-900/100` (MAXIMUM darkness!)
- ALL elements now use `purple-900` (darkest possible)
- ALL opacity pushed to 90-100% (near maximum)
- Added 7th purple element: bottom-left corner coverage
- Changed center gradient: `blue-200/20` → `purple-900/95` (no more blue!)

### Review Section:
**Task Completed:** Enhanced purple gradient visibility
**Changes:** Increased opacity on two purple gradient elements in App.tsx
**Impact:** Purple gradients are now more visible while maintaining subtle appearance
**Files Modified:** App.tsx (lines 901, 903)
**Result:** Purple gradient effect is more prominent across the background

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed gradient visibility issue (enhanced opacity and positioning)
- [x] Restarted development server to pick up Tailwind config changes

### Notes
- Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- Gradient changes should now be visible with enhanced opacity
- Will follow the 6-step workflow for all future changes
