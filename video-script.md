- Email field: "sarah1969@mailinator.com"
- Message field: "Lunch money - enjoy! üçï"

"I'll enter 1 ALGO as the amount and sarah1969@mailinator.com as the recipient email. Note that only an email is required - no wallet address needed. The email field is optional if you prefer to share the claim code through other secure channels."

**[Click "Send Funds" button ‚Üí First Pera Wallet notification appears on phone]**

"Clicking Send Funds requires two transaction approvals. The first creates the smart contract."

**[Show first approval on phone]**

"I'll approve the first transaction to create the contract..."

**[Show second approval on phone]**

"I'll approve this second transaction..."

**[Show success screen with claim code displayed prominently]**

"Perfect! Both transactions are complete. Here's the claim code displayed on screen - it's also been emailed to the recipient. The funds are now safely held in the smart contract."

### Real Email & Claiming (1:10-1:45)
**[Open new tab, navigate to https://www.mailinator.com]**

"Now let's check Sarah's email. I'll open a new tab and go to mailinator.com. In the search box, I'll type sarah1969 and press Enter."

**[Click on the RandCash email in the inbox]**

"Look! The RandCash email arrived with the claim code and instructions. I'll copy this code."

**[Open new incognito window, go to https://randcash.app]**

"Now let's switch to Sarah's perspective. I'll open an incognito window and go to randcash.app. Sarah would click the Claim tab here."

**[Click "Claim" tab, then show wallet setup]**

"But first, Sarah needs to set up her wallet too. She'd download Pera Wallet, create an account, then connect it here. Let me quickly get her some test funds as well..."
