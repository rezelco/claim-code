Enhance the Background Visuals:

Modify src/App.tsx: Adjust the main container's background to include a more dynamic gradient or subtle overlay that adds depth without distracting from the content. This can involve tweaking the existing bg-gradient-to-br classes or adding a pseudo-element with a radial gradient.
Refine Header Layout and Styling:

Modify src/App.tsx: Adjust the padding and spacing within the header. Ensure the wallet connection/disconnection button and the network selector have consistent styling with other interactive elements, possibly using a more subtle background for the network selector to integrate it better.
Improve Main Form Container Distinction:

Modify src/App.tsx: Enhance the bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl p-8 border border-white/20 classes for the main form and side panel. Consider increasing the bg-white/10 opacity slightly (e.g., bg-white/15) or adding a more pronounced but soft shadow to make these containers stand out more from the background.
Enhance Input Field Grouping in "Send" Tab:

Modify src/App.tsx: Within the "Send" tab's form, group the input fields (Amount, Recipient Email, Message) into logical sections. This could involve wrapping each input group in a div with a slightly different background color or a subtle border to visually separate them, improving readability.
Improve Claim Status Display:

Modify src/App.tsx: For the claimStatus display in the "Claim" tab, enhance its visual presentation. Use more prominent icons (e.g., larger CheckCircle, XCircle, AlertTriangle) and ensure the text is clearly legible. Consider adding a distinct background color or border to the status box that aligns with the message type (success, error, info).
Redesign "Your Contracts" List:

Modify src/App.tsx: Transform each contract item within the "Your Contracts" list into a more distinct card. Add more padding and margin around each div representing a contract.
Improve the visual hierarchy of information: make the Application ID more prominent, and clearly display the amount, balance, and status.
Style the "Refund" and "Delete" buttons within each contract card to be smaller, more action-oriented buttons, possibly using text-red-400 and text-orange-400 with hover effects.
Add an ExternalLink icon next to the Application ID or Contract Address, allowing users to easily view the contract on the Algorand explorer. This would involve adding a new <a> tag with the appropriate href constructed using the explorerUrl from NETWORK_CONFIGS in src/types/network.ts.
