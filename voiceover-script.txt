Hi! I'm presenting RandCash - a solution for sending cryptocurrency using just an email address.

Before we start, you'll need the Pera Wallet app on your phone and at least 1 ALGO to cover the amount you want to send and the transaction fees - I'll show you how to get both.

Let me show you how it works!

First, I'll go to randcash.app and switch to TestNet for this demonstration.

Select TestNet from the network dropdown before connecting your wallet.

Now I'll click Connect Wallet, which shows me a QR code. If you don't have Pera Wallet yet, there's a convenient download QR code right here - just scan it with your phone's camera to get the app from your app store.

With Pera Wallet installed, scan the connection QR code to link your wallet.

Perfect! The wallet is now connected to TestNet.

Now let's get some test funds. I'll click my wallet address to copy it.

Now I'll scroll to the bottom of the page where there's a convenient link to the TestNet Dispenser. I'll click this link to open the Algorand test money faucet.

Here I'll paste my wallet address and click Dispense.

Great! I now have 10 test ALGO for the demo.

Back on randcash.app, let's send 1 ALGO!

I'll enter 1 ALGO as the amount and sarah1969@mailinator.com as the recipient email. Note that only an email is required - no wallet address needed. The email field is optional if you prefer to share the claim code through other secure channels.

Clicking Send Funds requires two transaction approvals. The first creates the smart contract.

I'll approve the first transaction to create the contract...

Now the second approval - this one actually transfers the ALGO into the smart contract where it's held securely until Sarah claims it. This two-step process ensures maximum security.

I'll approve this second transaction...

Perfect! Both transactions are complete. Here's the claim code displayed on screen - it's also been emailed to the recipient. The funds are now safely held in the smart contract.

Now let's check Sarah's email. I'll open a new tab and go to mailinator.com. In the search box, I'll type sarah1969 and press Enter.

Look! The RandCash email arrived with the claim code and instructions. I'll copy this code.

Now let's switch to Sarah's perspective. I'll open an incognito window and go to randcash.app. Sarah would click the Claim tab here.

But first, Sarah needs to set up her wallet too. She'd download Pera Wallet, create an account, then connect it here. Let me quickly get her some test funds as well...

Now with her wallet funded, she pastes the claim code we copied from the email right here in this field and clicks Claim ALGO.

After one approval - the 1 ALGO is instantly transferred to her wallet!

Back in my original browser on randcash.app, I'll click the My Contracts tab to see all my transfers.

Perfect! The transfer now shows as 'Claimed'. If it hadn't been claimed within 7 days, I could refund it back to myself.

I can see all the details - the amount, recipient, claim status, and even click to view the transaction on the Algorand blockchain explorer. Everything is transparent and verifiable.

For the Custom Domain Challenge, we've deployed RandCash on our own professional domain - randcash.app. Short, simple, and memorable - exactly what you want for a financial app!

Using a custom domain instead of generic hosting URLs builds instant trust with users - critical for a money transfer app.

For Algorand's Blockchain Challenge, RandCash uses Algorand smart contracts to solve a real problem - secure peer-to-peer money transfers without sharing wallet addresses!

Every transfer creates an on-chain escrow using TEAL smart contracts. We're powered by Nodely's reliable node infrastructure for both TestNet and MainNet. The blockchain ensures data integrity while our SHA-256 hashing keeps claim codes secure.

For Netlify's Deploy Challenge, RandCash is a full-stack application deployed with continuous integration. Our Netlify team account handles everything - frontend hosting, serverless functions, and automatic deployments.

Push to GitHub, and within seconds it's live globally with HTTPS, CDN distribution, and production-ready infrastructure!

RandCash simplifies cryptocurrency transfers by eliminating the need for wallet addresses. Just use email.
